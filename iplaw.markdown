## Why I want to be an IP Lawyer
I have always (for the most part), wanted to practice law. Sure the suit and tie is fun, but I get extreem satisfaction in helping people; whether its to advance justice, protect inventions created by the most brilliant minds in the world, or simply direct people to begin their journey to better this world, I want to be the catalyst for it.
