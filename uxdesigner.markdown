## Why I am interested in UX Design
Though this can also apply to IP Law, I think the design and interaction between applications and their users is very important to both how we advance in technology, how we collect data, but also what our morales are. If we create applications where the user is a product, and not a person, we slowly begin to comodify people; which is wrong. I want to create UX that put the user **first**.
